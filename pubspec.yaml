  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/bg1.jpg
    - assets/bg2.jpg
    - assets/habbalogo.png
    - assets/apllogo.png
    - assets/icon.png
    - assets/Olympics.png
    - assets/kaala.png
    - assets/1stplace.png
    - assets/3rdplace.png
    - assets/2ndplace.png
    - assets/prize.png
    - assets/nopaw.png
    - assets/sirfpaw.png
    - assets/onlypaw.png
    - assets/rajan.jpeg
    - assets/bharath.jpeg
    - assets/ashwin.jpeg
    - assets/varshini.jpeg
    - assets/shubham.jpeg
    - assets/nikhil.jpeg
#    - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: ProductSans
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/PSR.ttf
         - asset: assets/PSB.ttf
     - family: Vetica
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/vetica.ttf
        #         - asset: assets/PSB.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
